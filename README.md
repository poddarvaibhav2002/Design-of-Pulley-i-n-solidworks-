# Design-of-Pulley-i-n-solidworks-
Design a pulley in SolidWorks by sketching its half-profile on the Front Plane. Use Revolved Boss/Base to create the 3D shape. Add a center bore and keyway with Extruded Cut. Include spokes if needed. Apply fillets, material, and appearance. Save and render the model if required.
